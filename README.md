# CPU-Scheduler
Golang program that mimics a cpu scheduler

# How To Run
In terminal or command prompt type `go build pa1.go`

Then to run specific file type `pa1 /pa1Testing-rls-01/rls/input/<file>.in /pa1Testing-rls-01/rls/output/<file>.out`

This will create <file>.out in the `/pa1Testing-rls-01/rls/output` directory
  
To check if the output is correct type `diff /pa1Testing-rls-01/rls/output/<file>.out /pa1Testing-rls-01/rls/answer/<file>.base`

These commands assume you are in the parent directory
